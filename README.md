this is for you swashbuckling eyepatchers who read manga off of mangakatana
basically im also a swashbuckling eyepatcher so i made this python script ig

how to use:
  pip install all of the stuff (pypdf, os, img2pdf, and PIL)
  extract manga into same directory as python script
  make sure directories are like this:
  whatever/mgst.py and whatever/manga/c001 (c001 and all of the other chapters)
  run the python script
  it'll ask you what paper size (i just do letter (8.5 x 11 in))
  then it'll ask you which folder to stitch (do the manga root folder (manga in my example))
  then which chapters (for example 1,5 for chapters 1-5 in the manga folder) IMPORTANT: you have to do the actual chapter numbers
  then it'll ask you how many images there are in each chapter (for example, if there are 20 images in the 1st chapter, 31 images in the second, and 19 in the third put 20,31,19)
  then yeah its done
